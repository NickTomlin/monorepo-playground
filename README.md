# monorepo-playground
*note: wip*

Playing around with npm workspaces + github actions to build out a toy project.

## Goals

This repo exposes a multi-package project that hopefully encompases a typical OSS project with `n` packages

```
- packages
  * cli (published to npm)
    - A command line runner
  * http (published to npm)
    - An http client (for standalone use and also used by cli)
  * [maybe more]...
```
