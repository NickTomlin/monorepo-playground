## 4/9/2022 Direction: attempt to use decoupled/`vanilla` solutions as much as possible

I'd like to see how far I can get with just `npm`, `tsc` (maybe `tsup` :upside_down_smiling_face:) and `changesets`. Changesets still has magic, but it's relatively clear in its approach.

## 4/9/2022 Not to use `nx` or other "batteries included" monorepo build systems

[`nx`](https://nx.dev/) seems really really cool. It also seems pretty interested in its own ecosystem and that scares me a little. If the goal is to use this as a collaborative platform with open source engineers things need to be extremely open and hopefully easy to understand. I'd prefer to pay a slight cost in having things be slower and slightly clunkier than have lots of magic that is hard for someone else (or me in 2 months) to understand without a deep dive.
